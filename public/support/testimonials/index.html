<p>Why Support WRCCDC &hellip; our student competitors share why.</p>

<h3 id="confidence-to-achieve-great-things">Confidence to achieve great things.</h3>

<p>Nana Rei shared on WRCCDC&rsquo;s Facebook page:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;My CCDC experience has given me confidence, shown me that I can achieve great things, and has humbled me. I am completely new to the competition and to information security. My teammates have shown me that I can achieve anything as long as I do not quite. Being one of the few women on the team and with the least amount of knowledge and experience, my teammates and my instructor have brought me closer to my goals and expanded my knowledge. <br><br> The competition itself has tested my skills and humbled me in ways I would not have imagined. I am thankful for being accepted by my mates and for them to trust me in times of stress, throughout the challenges, and as an equal. I felt accepted, appreciated, and grateful for the experience. Without this competition and these challenges, my teammates and I would not have formed our team, we would not have appreciated each other&rsquo;s skills, and I would not have been accepted into the brotherhood of infosec. Thank you for the experience.&rdquo;</p>

<p>James Olson – My WRCCDC Experience <br>
UAT Alumni <br>
Blue Team 2015, 2016 <br>
Black Team 2017 – Present</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The WRCCDC has been and continues to be one of the greatest experiences of my life. I fell in love with the concept and competition from the first time I competed on Blue team back in 2015. I stayed in school another year just to compete again in 2016 and our team took 2nd place. In 2017 I decided I wanted to be a part of the WRCCDC team for as long as possible and joined the Black Team and am now, and hope to be for a while, a member of the WRCCDC family. <br><br>
When I first started I was impressed with the concept, but as just a student at the time I was not even fully aware of the massive benefit that the competition would be to me until I graduated. I am currently a Tier 2 SOC annalist for a large bank and spend most of my free time doing offensive security. I have just passed the OSCP and while doing that I realize that the CCDC competition is the Blue Team equivalent of the OSCP. Apart from the technical aspects of the competition, skills like communication, project management, team work, and critical thinking are all strengthened. <br><br>
The competitions are difficult and will tend to bring the worst out in people due to stress, the “optimization” of the network to start with, and the shear destruction that Red Team can bring. This to me was the most important part of the competition. Tests like this are supposed to be overly stressful. The value is that now any situation that comes up in the real world will seem like child’s play and will allow for team members to keep a cool head and focus on the objective. <br><br>
As a leader in my team at my current Job I can say without a doubt that applicants for Tier 1 SOC who have any CCDC involvement on their resume as shot to the top of my list. In fact, several members of our team have competed in the WRCCDC in the past. <br><br>
I have loved every minute of my involvement with the WRCCDC and hope to see Schools and Students become engaged in this competition for many years to come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ravi Shah - My WRCCDC Experience</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I studied Computer Information Systems at Cal Poly Pomona. I was involved with three student clubs ( 2 as an attendee and 1 in leading). When I learned about WRCCDC competition during my senior year, it was bit too late for me to participate as a blue team member. So I volunteered for the competition as a black team (helped with competition preparation/setup/tear-down etc). This experience was extremely valuable to me as a student. I met with lots of great people at the competition who are eager to share their knowledge. I got to experience as close to “real-world” as possible about blue team and red team. <br><br> I was amazed to meet and chat with some of the best people in the Security sharing their knowledge and advise to new people in the industry. I was blessed with good opportunity to network. I networked with few members of my current employer which helped me secure an interview and eventually get a job. Now I’ve been with Workday for 4+ years. <br><br> My advice to students: Get involved in the community and volunteer/participate however you can. There is lot to learn and share and you will get to meet lots of security rock stars&rdquo;.</p>
