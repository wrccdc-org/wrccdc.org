<hr />
<h2 id="section-8---questions-disputes--disclosure">Section 8 - Questions, Disputes, &amp; Disclosure</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>a.</strong> PRIOR TO THE COMPETITION: Team captains are encouraged to work with the Competition Director and their staff to resolve any questions regarding the rules of the competition or scoring methods before the competition begins.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>b.</strong> DURING THE COMPETITION: Protests by any team must be presented in writing by the Team Captain to the White Team as soon as possible.  The competition officials will be the final arbitrators for any protests or questions arising before, during, or after the competition.  Rulings by the competition officials are final. All competition results are official and final as of the Closing Ceremony.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>c.</strong> In the event of an individual disqualification, that team member must leave the competition area immediately upon notification of disqualification and must not re-enter the competition area at any time.  Disqualified individuals are also ineligible for individual or team awards.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>d.</strong> In the event of a team disqualification, the entire team must leave the competition area immediately upon notice of disqualification and is ineligible for any individual or team award.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>e.</strong> All competition materials including injects, scoring sheets, and team-generated reports and documents must remain in the competition area.  Only materials brought into the competition area by the student teams may be removed after the competition concludes.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2 id="section-9---scoring">Section 9 - Scoring</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>a.</strong> Scoring will be based on keeping required services up, controlling/preventing un-authorized access, and completing business tasks that will be provided throughout the competition.  Teams accumulate points by successfully completing injects and maintaining services.  Teams lose points by violating service level agreements, usage of recovery services, and successful penetrations by the Red Team.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>b.</strong> Scores will be maintained by the competition officials and may be shared at the end of the competition.  There will be no guarantee of running totals provided during the competition.  Team rankings may be provided at the beginning of each competition day.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>c.</strong> Any team action that interrupts the scoring system is exclusively the responsibility of that team and will result in a lower score.  Any team member that modifies a competition system or system component, with or without intent, in order to mislead the scoring engine into assessing a system or service as operational, when in fact it is not, may be disqualified and/or the team assessed penalties. Should any question arise about scoring, the scoring engine, or how scoring functions, the Team Captain should immediately contact the competition officials to address the issue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>d.</strong> Teams are strongly encouraged to provide incident reports for each Red Team incident they detect.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>e.</strong> Incident reports can be completed as needed throughout the competition and presented to the White Team for collection.  Incident reports must contain a description of what occurred (including source and destination IP addresses, timelines of activity, passwords cracked, access obtained, damage done, etc), a discussion of what was affected, and a remediation plan.  A thorough incident report that correctly identifies and addresses a successful Red Team attack may reduce the Red Team penalty for that event – no partial points will be given for incomplete or vague incident reports.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="section-10---remote-team-site-judging--compliance">Section 10 - Remote Team Site Judging &amp; Compliance</h2>
